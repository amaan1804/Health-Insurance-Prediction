# Health-Insurance-Prediction

In this project, we performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset and 
built a linear regression model to predict health insurance prices.

We will process the data, explore correlations and relationships using visualizations,
selecte relevant features based on EDA insights, build and train a model, and evaluat its performance.
